* **Cosmoverse 2024**: Cosmoverse is the single largest conference for the entire Cosmos ecosystem, with its 2024 event aiming to attract over 2000 attendees. The grant will promote the Cosmos Hub, its technology and innovation, and the AEZ projects that are driving value to the Hub — before, after, and at the conference.

* **Asteroid Protocol: Supercharging Inscriptions on the Cosmos Hub**: Establish the Cosmos Hub as a permanent data storage layer, facilitating DeFi activities like minting and swapping NFTs and fungible tokens. The grant’s goals include integrating advanced functionality in NFT and CFT20 marketplaces — from the ability to launch NFT collections to floor-sweeping functionality; expanding interoperability through cross-chain transfers of NFTs and CFT20s; and introducing novel experiments to advance activity on the Hub. Initial payment was made on April 19th, 2024. The milestone payment focuses on enhancing the Cosmos Hub's capabilities within the NFT and CFT20 marketplaces. It includes launching NFT collections with detailed metadata, deploying "floor-sweeping" functionality for CFT20s, and enabling the exchange of NFTs with CFT20s. These advancements aim to broaden the platform's user base and use cases, potentially influencing the value proposition of ATOM within the ecosystem.

* **"Spelldrop": The ATOM Airdrop Explorer**: Everstake is developing an “Atom Value Accrual” tracker. This essential tool comprehensively illustrates and continuously tracks the growth in value derived from staking ATOM, alongside capturing all the airdrops ATOM stakers have qualified for. Everstake’s grant will include the delivery of API endpoints — allowing wallets, platforms and other UIs to access and make visible this data on other dashboards across Cosmos and other ecosystems. Currently, you can track up to 6 airdrops including Osmosis, Evmos, Neutron, Saga, Juno and Celestia: [spelldrop](https://spelldrop.xyz/). Payment of $15,878 was made to initiate the first milestone --  the "milestone focuses on setting up project management tools and communication channels, identifying and onboarding project team members, conducting market research to understand target chains for data collection, and defining UI features while preparing mockups. The goal is to establish a comprehensive platform that provides users with detailed visualizations and data about airdrops and staking activities within the Cosmos ecosystem since 2020. This platform will offer retrospective data display capabilities, enabling wallet owners to conveniently access their historical data."

* **Lava Network; Incentivized Public RPC for the Cosmos Hub**: Lava Network’s incentivized Public RPC model aims to provide fast, reliable, and scalable access to the Cosmos Hub’s data. By consolidating several top RPC providers into a single endpoint, Lava ensures performant access to data, constant availability and cost efficiency for the user. The objective of this grant to fund this critical public infrastructure will enable innovative dApps, dashboards and other use cases to flourish without being held back by unreliable RPC endpoints. Metrics for success include the percentage of Cosmos Hub RPC traffic handled by Lava's public endpoint, latency, uptime, and sync benchmarks, as well as user and developer satisfaction measured through Interchain projects connected to the Cosmos Hub via IBC. 

* **Isle Incentivized Testnet, "Big Testnet"**: ?

* **Cosmos Hub Awareness - LATAM**: This grant proposal aims to increase awareness and facilitate user and developer onboarding for the Cosmos ecosystem Latin America (LATAM) focusing on Argentina. By creating engaging and informative content, this initiative seeks to educate the LATAM community about the benefits and opportunities offered by the Cosmos ecosystem, thereby encouraging adoption and participation within the network.

* **Quadratic Funding**: On-chain funding distribution mechanism based on the result of [quadratic governance](https://research.dorahacks.io/2022/07/11/quadratic-governance/), an innovative governance scheme that is often considered an improvement of the traditional 1-person-1-vote or 1-dollar-1-vote model. With a quadratic voting algorithm, the power of each vote to a single project from a single contributor will decrease, which would prevent funding distribution from extreme preferences of whale voters. For more details, please read [Quadratic Funding & Voting Guide](https://hidorahacks.medium.com/what-is-quadratic-voting-funding-how-did-we-improve-it-70989e813cf9).

* **ICS 2.0 Community Education**: Evaluation frameworks to help chains (prospective PSS candidates) assess how many validators a chain may need, and how to qualify validators and their related services (e.g.,relevant security parameters). The modeling will include relevant economic costs (financial metrics) -- this initiative will help chains and validators make more informed decisions in accordance with revenue projections and or cost basis estimates.

* **Cosmos Hub @EthCC**: Funding for irl Cosmos Hub event at EthCC, Brussels. 

* **Intermediate Funding for Cosmos IBC Relayer Transaction Fees**: This grant is a stopgap solution for lack of IBC relayer incentivization. 

* **"Road to Dubai"**: "Road to Dubai" is a builder talent acquisition initiative to bring new developers to the global stage. It includes education, workshops and mini contest from
local builder communities to screen talents. In the end, selected teams will participate in Cosmoverse Conference and Hackmos hackathons. Ludium is a Web3 Builder Community focused on providing information, education, and
bounty opportunities for builders to transition their career into Web3. All materials on Ludium are open sourced for the public usage. For the past 3 years, Ludium conducted
education and bounty programs for Ethereum Ecosystem, Multichain Foundations, Government and community. Ludium will be a strategic partner in developing events and education based marketing in Korean, a key regional market for Cosmos.

* **PSS Economic Model Frontend**: This grant will build the website front end for the PSS Economic Model (created by another grantee of AADAO). The primary purpose is to make that economic model more accessible, dynamic and user-friendly. The front end will need to:
  * Help users figure out which validator they should stake with (PSS means different rewards with different validators)
  * Help validators figure out the cost vs reward of running a Consumer Chain. They can then decide not to run a chain
  * Consumer Chains figure out the economic cost of the security they want/need, helping them create blacklists based on validator metrics, etc.
 
* **ATOM-Based NFT Minting and Creator Incentives**: This grant will be utilized to establish ATOM as a mint denomination on Stargaze with an accompanying campaign to incentivize NFT creators to launch collections using ATOM. This project will leverage Stargaze’s role as a cultural hub in the Cosmos alongside its close connection to outside communities such as Ethereum NFT networks to establish a new use case for the ATOM token (NFT trading) as well as introduce marketing, narrative, and cultural value via NFT communities that form around ATOM-minted collections. The main components include:
  * implementing ATOM as a mint denomination on Stargaze
  * launching “Atom August, 4 weeks where all Stargaze Featured projects will mint in ATOM
  * incentivizing high profile creators to produce signature collections during ATOM August
  * marketing and outreach campaigns around items 1 to 3

* **Margined Finance**: Aims to extend its vault framework to support delta-neutral liquidity provisioning (LPing). This innovation allows users to deposit into a vault that LPs into a specific pool while simultaneously creating a hedge for the LP position’s value. The system significantly lowers LPing risks by reducing exposure to both realized and impermanent loss.

Grant Goals:

Develop a Novel Vault Framework: Enable low-risk LPing for Cosmos blue-chip tokens.

Initial Use-Case: Deploy the framework for the Hydro platform.

Future Applications: Expand the framework to enhance liquidity provision for platforms like Osmosis DEX, Neutron DEX, and Mars.
