*Please be advised that the designation "TBA" (To Be Announced) indicates that AADAO is contractually bound by non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements that preclude the public dissemination of specific details pertaining to certain venture investments. Such disclosure is contingent upon either a formal announcement by the investee or explicit authorization from the counterparty permitting the public sharing of investment activity details. It is the considered opinion of Oversight's elected member that these confidentiality obligations create a potential conflict with AADAO's public reporting responsibilities. Furthermore, it remains ambiguous to what extent Cosmos Hub governance has conferred limited autonomy upon AADAO regarding the expansion of key activities, particularly in the realm of venture investments. For the sake of transparency, it should be noted that the team has internally allocated $5 million for venture investments and $3 million for grants.* 

*However, it is not definitively established whether this distribution aligns with the mandate renewed under Proposal 865. This ambiguity raises potential governance and compliance issues that may require further clarification and, potentially, additional ratification by Cosmos governance to ensure full compliance with AADAO's operational mandate and public accountability obligations.*
